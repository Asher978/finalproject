				<p><span>Craig Mayes</span> has served as Chief Executive Officer of the New York City Rescue Mission (NYCRM), America’s first homeless shelter. Committed to advocating for, and serving the poor and homeless in both local and global capacities, Dr. Mayes has taken the NYCRM through a re-branding and an $11 million dollar expansion at their facility in lower Manhattan, where they provide emergency shelter for hundreds of men and women daily, and a residential Recovery Program for homeless men struggling with addiction. Dr. Mayes also serves as the Chairperson of the Board of the Association of Gospel Rescue Missions (AGRM), which is comprised of more than 300 missions and shelters across the United States and Canada.

				In 2003 Dr. Mayes helped found Impact India 360, a non-profit helping impoverished communities in rural India. Impact India 360 has built orphanages, schools, an elderly care home, and most recently a hospital. He continues to serve on the board and spends time in India each year.

				Dr. Mayes has also worked in higher education, teaching undergraduate and graduate courses in ethics, counseling, psychology and theology. He served as a pastor at two churches in the Detroit, Michigan area and currently co-leads Communitas Church in NYC, a faith community for the homeless.
				Most recently Dr. Mayes co-founded the Make Them Visible Foundation (MTVF) - the first collaborative movement in the country representing non-profits fighting against homelessness. MTVF’s innovative approach is two-fold: secure funding for its network of non-profits providing deep programmatic impact, and partner with brands and media to create a cultural shift humanizing the homeless. MTVF received an Effie Award (Effies honor the most effective marketing communications ideas) for its short film ‘Make Them Visible’.

				Dr. Mayes holds a MA in Theology, a MA in Counseling, and a Ph.D. in Counseling </p>

				Over the preceding two decades, Dan founded and grew a small health care start-up with 1,000 employees and $20 million in annual revenue, to a company with 15,000 employees across 85 locations, and an annual revenue of just under $1 billion. Dan’s accomplishments in business and leadership have been featured in national health care magazines, highlighting his ability to transform poor health care operations into successful ventures.

				Dan has served in a leadership capacity on numerous boards of international non-profit organizations, including Shepherd Community Center, Hernando County Chamber of Commerce, Hope of Ethiopia, Forge Ministries (formerly Kingdom Building Ministries), Truthseekers International, Herron High School, Great Commission Ministries, and Christians for Assaf Haroffa.

				As the youngest chairman of the board for the Hernando County Chamber of Commerce, Dan provided leadership in merging two business chambers into one. During his eight years at Forge Ministries, Dan focused on board development and strategic planning. Dan provided personal mentoring and leadership to the organizational founder of Truthseekers International, a social and spiritual movement that has made great strides in bringing reconciliation among Indian castes and religions. At Herron High School, Dan chaired the capital campaign to raise $4.5 million for the development of a charter school created to serve high risk inner city teens. At Great Commission Ministries, Dan provided leadership on the ministry's re-branding, as well as executive mentoring of the ministry’s President.

				<p><span>Jerome Wright</span> Men's Services Manager
				Jerome received his Associate Degree in Human and Social Services from Essex County College, subsequently obtaining a Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology and Christian Counseling from Pillar College. Jerome served at the Goodwill Rescue Mission in Newark from 2008 to 2014, across several roles such as Program Associate for the Men's Discipleship Program, Emergency Services Supervisor for the Men's Homeless Shelter, and Assistant Program Director. As the Men’s Services Manager at the New York City Rescue Mission, Jerome also provides counseling in the residential Recovery Program.

				Jerome’s personal story of homelessness and hardship, as well as seeing the poverty and despair in his neighborhood fuelled a love and a desire to help those who are troubled and want to live a better outcome. Jerome believes a life that is not used to help another life is a wasted one, and he refuses to sit around and waste his.</p>
